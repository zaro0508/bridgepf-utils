***Instructions of Elastic Beanstalk deployment of BridgePF***

1.	Assumes presence of properly named s3 buckets for config, including
	*	deployment bucket (on mine I used com-museborn-deployment-dev)
	*	Other standard buckets are specified at launch time of cloudformation
	
2.	Assumes cert for domains are created in AWS->Cert manager (recommend wildcard cert like *.sagebase.org)
	
3.	Pull BridgePF code:
	* 	cd BridgePF
	*	sbt clean dist
	*	aws s3 cp target/universal/bridgepf-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip s3://DEPLOYMENTBUCKET/
	
4.	Clone Repos: git@github.com:Sage-Bionetworks/bridgepf-utils.git

5.	Go to AWS->Cloudformation and create new stack
	*	Use template from bridgepf-utils/BridgePF-env.template
	*	AppDeployBucket should be above bucket. 
	*	AppDeployFile is bridgepf-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
	*	SSLCertArn is ARN from certificate manager for proper cert
	*	DNS Hostname and domain set up Route 53 mapping to load balancer
	*	Bridge env and user match settings in config file
	*	All other setting should match desired production/dev environment. Defaults are currently for my environment, but easy to set to appropriate Sage settings
	
6.	On launch, app should be accessible via https://HOSTNAME.DOMAINNAME as expected
	
7.	In code .travis.yml, add stanza for elastic beanstalk deployment:
	* 	Run 'travis setup elasticbeanstalk' from source directory, input settings from AWS. (Outputs tab of Cloudformation stack should provide env string)
	*	To env steps add: (only necessary if settings vary significantly from defaults in code, specifically s3 buckets.)
		*	mkdir -p $HOME/bridge
		*	bash $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/dist/create_bridge_config.sh
	*	In elasticbeanstalk deploy stanza (with appropriate settings), assure the following settings exist:
		*	skip_cleanup: true
		*	bucket_name: DEPLOYMENTBUCKET
		*	zip_file: target/universal/bridgepf-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
	*	Pushing to travis should test and push to both heroku and elastic beanstalk now

8.	Suggest testing reds on travis itself instead of remotely:
	*	At top of travis.yml add
		*	services:
			*	redis-server
	*	Specify REDIS_URL as redis://AWS:AWS@localhost:6379 in travis ENV
